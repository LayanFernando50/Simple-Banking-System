The Simple Banking System offers a range of features for users to manage their accounts. New users can create an account by providing their name, email, and password. Existing users can securely log in to access their account features. The system allows users to deposit or withdraw funds, with each transaction being recorded. Users can also view their current account balance in real-time and check a summary of their deposits and withdrawals, organized by date. The system includes a fund transfer feature that simulates sending funds to another account, and users can update their account details as needed.

In terms of Project Overview, user details and transaction data are stored in lists and written to a text file called database.txt, simulating a database. The user flow begins with the creation of an account or user login, after which they can access various banking functions through a simple menu system.
